## My process

### Built with

- SCSS
- Vanilla JavaScript
- BEM methodology
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

In this challenge, I learned how to use fontawesome icon library. In terms of sizing the icons, it's easier to put a custom class name on the respective icon and adjust its width and height with the font-size property.
